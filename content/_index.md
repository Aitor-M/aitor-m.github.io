I am a graphics programming enthusiast that has developed both DirectX 12 and OpenGL engines. I have also been involved in the development of two videogames:
- Old Town Stories: a VR game made with UE4 which is currently published on Steam.
- Arena Of Warfare: a tower defense android game published on the Play Store.

I have been studying programming for six years, the last four specialized in videogames.
