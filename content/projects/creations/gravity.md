Gravity Shifter is a 2D platformer game based on gravity, movement fluidity and slow motion.

### The Challenge
Gravity Shifter is played by using just the two joysticks on the controller. UI included. It was a design request made by my professor [@SuperLemonBits](https://twitter.com/superlemonbits)!
