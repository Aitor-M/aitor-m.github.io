### Contribution
* "VR integration: The player's Pawn VR related input and hand animations integration."
* VR optimization : Making sure the project had a stable 90 fps was a challenge due to the realistic look of the game. Some of the optimizations were: making sure there were no transparencies, level-streaming, using as simple as posible materials, HLODs, static lights..."
* Magnetic Shield (gameplay): Shield which stops, accumulates and returns enemy bullets.
* Niagara VFX: bullet trails, magnetic shield, smoke particles and gun firing effect
